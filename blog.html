		<strong class="card-name">Rionya, Fire Dancer</strong> is a card that allows the player to make copies of another creature at the begining of combat that go away at the end of turn. The more spells you cast earlier in the turn, the more copies she creates. This mechanic interested me when I got the card, and recently I decided to build a deck around her. While building the deck I incorperated a few simple but powerful concepts. The three most important elements of the deck are: good creatures to copy, low cost spells to play, and extra combat spells. Some creatures have very simple payoffs like mana generation or card draw, while others enable massive game ending combats. Creatures like <strong class="card-name">Elturel Survivors</strong> can overwhelm opponents with just a few copies being made. A couple noncombat win conditions are in the deck too. Having multiple <strong class="card-name">Fanatic of Mogis</strong> tokens enter in the same turn can easily cause each opponents' life total to drop significantly. <strong class="card-name">Witty Roastmaster</strong> and the enchantment <strong class="cardname>Impact Tremors</strong> both turn token creation into burn damage. All this would be okay on its own, but what really makes the deck shine in my eyes is extra combats. Copying different creatures in subsequent combats can lead to much more powerful and dangerous combined effects. Cards like <strong class="card-name">Combat Celebrant</strong> and <strong class="card-name">Aggrevated Assault</strong> can even enable infinate combats. After playing the deck a few times I'm very pleased with its preformance and play style.
